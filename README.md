# Expense-Tracker



We have an estimate or total amount an individual can spend monthly.
And he can add the expense,remove the expense,give priority to expense,add a related expense like food which can have a nested monthly budget and inside food can add other expenses in food like restaurant,house,grocery,etc.
The final amount will keep on decreasing as you keep on adding expense and vice-versa.
It uses Python,django and mysql for backend along with html,css,materialize,google font api and javascript for frontend.
